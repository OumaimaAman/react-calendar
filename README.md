## Description
This is a React application featuring two calendars: a daily calendar and a monthly calendar.

Daily Calendar
The daily calendar displays events for the current day, the previous day, and the next day.

Monthly Calendar
The monthly calendar provides an overview of the entire month. However, the event functionality has not been implemented in this calendar due to time constraints.
